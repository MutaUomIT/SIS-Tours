            Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage started off with five abandoned wild elephants as the Sri Lanka culture background treats human and animal alike. Vijaya, Neela, Kadira, Mathalee and Kumari were the first five lucky elephants to be cared under the supervision of the kind caretakers. They were misplaced and abandoned baby elephants, that they cannot survive themselves on their own until about five years of age. they hence need to be hand   raised for their survival.
            The institution cares not only abandoned baby elephants they also take care of the once who are injured and maimed while living in the jungle, under the care of well-educated and experienced veterinary staff and traditional indigenous medical needs to cater the individual elephant’s needs.
